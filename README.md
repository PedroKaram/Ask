# Motivation

 - I made this project because of a side project at university where we'll have this kind of "feed" and "post creation system" in our application.

# First commit

 - Did the basic bootstrap configuration
 - Created the 2 main routes for the application (feed and question creation)
 - Organized the partials and linked it on the ejs files

# What I intend to do on the next commit

 - End the design of both pages
 - Create and connect the database
 - Send the forms data to the database
 - Return the data on database to the feed
 - Add the .gitigone file
