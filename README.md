# Motivation

 - I'm working on this system because of a side project at university where we'll have this kind of "feed" and "post creation system" in our application.

# What was added

 - Ask page design done
 - Gitignore file done
 - Navbar done
 - Database created
 - Database connection done

# What I intend to do on the next commit

 - Send the forms data to database
 - Return the data on database to the feed
